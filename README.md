# Audio Visualiser
This project initially began as a side project being developed for my sister, who has always enjoyed music with visualiser effects.
working towards the deadline of her birthday, which gave me roughly a month for this project, I had a great time figuring out how to
make use of fast forier transforms and import files for the creation of this program.

## Core goals
The key goals I was working towards with this project were to make it look good (not necessarily complex, just simple and clean), to
make it capable of loading external files in some way, and to make it within the one month deadline. I am pleased to say that all of 
these have been achieved
